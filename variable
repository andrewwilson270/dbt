# Intro:
# Variables in dbt are useful for handling targeted refreshes on a much larger dataset.
# A default value is set for scheduled refreshes and you have the option is parsing a different value on a specific run.

# Useful docs

https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/using-variables

# Example
# We have a dataset that is refreshed for the past 7 days using an incremental table materialization by default. 
# We would like to run a custom refresh for a smaller date range than the default but only once.

Sample code in model

select ...
from my_table_name
where some_date between dateadd(day,'{{var("previous_days","-7")}}', current_date) and current date

# Run time code to refresh model

dbt run --models my_model_name --var "{'previous_days':'-3'}"
